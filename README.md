Tech-savvy members of the workforce may not have a whiteboard with the number of days left, but they are probably curious enough about when their last day of work is coming up. Retirement Countdown is an [Amazon Alexa](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Echo-Bluetooth-Speaker-with-WiFi-Alexa/dp/B00X4WHP5E) skill built to help these soon-to-be-retirees know simply by asking. Retirement Countdown will record the last day of work and then give the time left until freedom.

A very special acknowledgement to [Valerie Dodge](https://github.com/valoriedodge) for the [Pregnancy Countdown Alexa skill](https://github.com/valoriedodge/Pregnancy-Countdown), on which this skill is based.
